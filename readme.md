#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
In this project, I have analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. Afterwards I created a visualization and prepared a report describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. This project was part of the Udacity SQL nanodegree program.
